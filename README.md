# RotarySensor
This ULP for Eagle CAD creates a rotary capacitive touch sensor that allows for click wheel kind input. It's compatible with Atmels QTouch technology.

Credits go to Dan Afonso www.afonsoconsulting.com for building this software. I fixed a few bugs that created unconnected polygons and raised DRC errors. 

qslice.ulp is the script that creates the PCB copper pattern.
touch_pcb created the outline to form a touch sensor used by LittleHelper.

Have a look at the whole project to see why and for what kind of interfaces this is useful:
